James -

While it is fresh on my mind -- it would be great if you could capture the
following information before our meeting:

- the top 5 container technologies in each marketing region
- the number of deployments of each container per month
- copies of any user agreements we have with clients for those deployments
- projected customer growth estimates from Marketing
- total storage usage in cloud center 1

See you then, 
Richard
