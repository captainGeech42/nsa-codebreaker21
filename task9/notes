protocol

when server sends a command with PARAM_RUN, the output is sent with COMMAND_UPLOAD
    dirname = "runcmd"
    filename = argv[0]
    contents = stdout

command 0004 could be a request for tasking
    has a filepath, /tmp/endpoints/{uuid}/tasking\x00, vv sus

command 0005 could be a request for task contents

get tasks for /tmp/endpoints, it just lists the directory contents

had to remove my own bot UUIDs from the list, good thing i had a log
